##### Hello, this is *[Name]* and I am a  *[San Francisco resident/concerned community member/Bay Area Business Owner, etc.]*. 

##### I am calling in support of the "J20 Resisters" or the group of 11  people arrested on Inauguration Day 2017. 

##### I'm asking DA George Gascon to end the persecution of our friends and community members. 

##### The time and money required would be better spent protecting those most impacted by the Trump administration's racist and violent agenda, not a group of  protesters upholding the values you say you support. 

##### I urge you to drop the charges now.
